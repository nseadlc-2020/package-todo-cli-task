## Getting started

1. Install Python: Python is usually installed by default on most modern systems. To check what your currently have, open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   python3 --version
   ```

   This should output some information on the installed Python version.
   You can also install ruby by following these instructions: https://installpython3.com/

2. You are expected to write the code in `todo.py` file.

3. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\todo.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./todo.sh
   ```
